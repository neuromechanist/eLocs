# eLocs
*Functions to digitize EEG electrode locations (eLocs) using 3D scanners and motion capture systems*

## Tutorial
Sample digitization files for each digitizing method is provided in the `/sample/` folder. 
There is also a [detailed video instructions](https://youtu.be/n3VPYsReuq4) on 3D scanning and processing pipeline. 
For the other digitizing methods, send an email to [shirazi@ieee.org](mailto:shirazi@ieee.org).
